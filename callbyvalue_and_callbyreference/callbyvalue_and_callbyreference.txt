# in python all values assigned to the variables are treated as objects (e.g) a = 1000 , here 1000 is an object
Mutable objects: list, dict, set, byte array 
Immutable objects: int, float, complex, string, tuple, frozen set ,bytes

# When we pass mutable type of arguments/objects to the function , its called call by value or call by assignment 
# when we pass immutable type of arguments/objects to the function, its called call by reference or call by object reference


'''Python utilizes a system, which is known as 
“Call by Object Reference” or “Call by assignment”. 
In the event that you pass arguments like 
whole numbers, strings or tuples to a function,the passing is like call-by-value
because you can not change the  
value of the immutable objects being passed to the function. 
Whereas passing mutable objects can be considered as call by reference  
because when their values are changed inside the function, 
then it will also be reflected outside the function.'''
