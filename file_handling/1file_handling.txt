Before any reading or writing operation of any file,it must be
opened first
of all.Python provide built in function open() for it.On calling of
this function creates file object for file operations.

Syntax:
file object = open(<file_name>, <access_mode>,< buffering>)

file_name = name of the file ,enclosed in double quotes.
access_mode= Determines the what kind of operations can be
performed with file,like read,write etc.
Buffering = for no buffering set it to 0.for line buffering set it to 1.
if it is greater than 1 ,then it is buffer size.if it is negative then
buffer size is system default.

# File opening Modes 

1 r - reading only.Sets file pointer at beginning of the file . This is the default mode.
2 rb – same as r mode but with binary file
3 r+ - both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.
4 rb+ - same as r+ mode but with binary file
5 w - writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If not, creates a new file for writing.
6 wb – same as w mode but with binary file.
7 w+ - both writing and reading. Overwrites . If no file exist, creates a new file for R & W.
8 wb+ - same as w+ mode but with binary file.
9 a -for appending. Move file pointer at end of the file.Creates new file for writing,if not exist.
10 ab – same as a but with binary file.
11 a+ - for both appending and reading. Move file pointer at end. If the file does not exist, it creates a newfile for reading and writing.
12 ab+ - same as a+ mode but with binary mode.
